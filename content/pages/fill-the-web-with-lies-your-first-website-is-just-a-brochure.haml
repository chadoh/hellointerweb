Summary: Weâ€™ll stand on the shoulders of The Pacific Northwest Tree Octopus and make and publish our very own spoof site.

%h1 Week 2: Let's fill the web with lies! Your first website (is just a brochure)

:markdown
  topics: html, css, a teensy bit of command-line, git

  Outline
  -------

  * Download [Git][git] & [a Git GUI][gitx]
  * [tryruby.org][ruby] for 10m GO!
  * workin' with [someone else's HTML][zip] w00t!
  * _By the way command line & git whaaaat_
  * Don't worry, now we're doing CSS which you've already seen a little bit.
  * _A little more command line & git!!_
  

  Assignment
  ----------

  * Get your website to a decent place but _puh-lease_ don't be a perfectionist
  * Here's a command line reference so you can start feeling more comfortable getting around your computer the old-school way
  * Continue with [tryruby.org][ruby] if you feel like it (we'll be using it more starting Week 4)

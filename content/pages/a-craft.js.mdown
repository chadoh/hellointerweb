## Don't Destroy Anything

The HTML says to destroy everything you made when you post the form to
Server. Don't. Instead, just throw away the form that wasn't sent back
to Server. If the "Like!" form was sent, then just draw a heart in its
place. If the "dislike" form was sent, then draw some poop in its place.

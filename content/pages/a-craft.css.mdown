## The Picture

Give it a border of Popsicle sticks, and a background of brown paper.
You can paint or color these, if you want.

## The buttons

Fold them so the words aren't showing. On the "Like" button, draw a
heart. On the "dislike" button, draw poop.

Put both of the buttons in the bottom right corner of the frame,
with the heart on the right.

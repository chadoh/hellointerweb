    %p
      html, css, a teensy bit of ruby, a teensy bit of shell, git

  %h2 Try Ruby!
  %a(href='http://tryruby.org')

    alt='tryruby.org')
  :markdown
    <small>(That's a link!)</small>

    We'll be using this more in class 4, but there are good concepts that will
    help you with some things today &amp; next week, also.

      Then right-click "index.html" and open it with Sublime. Also open it with
      Chrome.

      Customize this HTML! Use what you've learned from [HTMLdog][dog] and fill
      this structure with info about your own fanciful creature.

      ![image of a terminal](http://blog.marc-seeger.de/assets/2009/12/30/terminal.png)

      If you're on windows, open up Git-Bash; on anything else, open up Terminal.

    %h2 Like typing commands on tryruby.org
    :markdown
      Except instead of executing Ruby code, you'll be executing _shell script_.

      I know that sounds crazy but don't worry!

      <small>This is how computers used to work, before Apple popularized
      [graphics][gui].</small>

        [gui]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface

      Just type each of these lines (don't copy & paste; you'll learn better!),
      hitting "enter" after each:

          $ cd Code/tree-octopus # Make this the folder that you saved your project to!
          $ git init
          $ git add .
          $ git commit -m "First commit"

  %h2 Great Artists Steal
  :markdown
    Hold your Alt key (Command key on a mac) and press Tab to switch back to
    Sublime. We'll come back to that git/shell/committing stuff and make sense
    of it in a little bit.

    For now, let's start customizing your CSS.

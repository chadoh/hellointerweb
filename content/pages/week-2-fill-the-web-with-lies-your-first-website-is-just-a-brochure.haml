    %h2 Ok now back to HTML!
    %p
      Save &amp; unzip this.

             alt='tree-octopus.zip')
    %p
      Then right-click "index.html" and open it with Sublime. Also open it with
      Chrome.

      this structure with info about your own fanciful creature.

    %h2 Commit yr changes!
    %small
      (This won't make sense yet; just follow along; we'll come back &amp; make
      sense of it later.)

      If you're on windows, open up Git-Bash; on anything else, open up Terminal.

    %h2 Like typing commands on tryruby.org
    :markdown
      Except instead of Ruby code, you'll be executing _shell script_.  I know
      that sounds crazy but don't worry!

      <small>This is how computers used to work, before Apple popularized
      [graphics][gui].</small>

        [gui]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface

      Just type each of these lines (don't copy & paste; you'll learn better!),
      hitting "enter" after each:

          $ cd <the folder with your website>
          $ git init
          $ git add .
          $ git commit -m "First commit"

%section
  %h2 Great Artists Steal
  :markdown
    Hold your Alt key (Command key on a mac) and press Tab to switch back to
    Sublime. We'll come back to that git/shell/committing stuff and make sense
    of it later.

    For now, let's start customizing your CSS.

    <small>Pro Tip: Google maintains a [list of free fonts][font] you can
    use on your website!</small>

    %h2 Commit Yr Changes!
    :markdown
      I know, I know, you've much more you want to do. CSS takes forever. But
      let's commit your changes now. Hold Alt (Command on a Mac) and hit Tab
      to get back to Terminal/Git-Bash. Then do this:

          $ git add .
          $ git commit -m "Workin' on CSS, w00t w00t"

  %section
    %h2 What the git?
    :markdown
      Open up the [Git GUI][gitx] that you downloaded. It'll ask you to open a
      folder. Open the folder that your website is in.

      [![Try Git][badge]][try-git]

      _Preeeeeetty sweeeet_, right? You never need to worry about screwing
      anything up! Just _commit often_.

      <small>Git does **waaaay** more than that. Be excited! We'll learn more in
      week 4.</small>

    %h2 But what about this "shell" stuff?
    :markdown
      Great question. Just for you, I've put together [a non-nerd's guide to the command line][shell].

      Go through it at your leisure!

    %h2 Things to play with before next week
    :markdown
      * Trick out your index page. Make the CSS zippy. Make the HTML funny. Have
        fun! (Be done when it isn't fun anymore.)
      * Go through [a non-nerd's guid to the command line][shell] so all that
        command-line voodoo seems less magical & terrifying
      * Continue with [tryruby.org][ruby] if you feel like it (we'll be using it more starting Week 4)

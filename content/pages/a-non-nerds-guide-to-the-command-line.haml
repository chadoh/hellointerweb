    %h2 A Rich Heritage
    :markdown
      [Unix][unix] was invented in 1969. It's still one of the most-used
      operating systems in the world (all of Google's servers use it, for
      example). Mac OSX and Linux are based on it. When you use the command
      line, you're using your computer the way people used computers decades
      before colorful screens and the mouse were in use.

    %h2 Shell
    :markdown
      The [Bourne Shell][sh] (abbreviated as simply _sh_) was created as a way
      to interact with Unix in 1977.  Lots of other shells were invented later
      that added more features.  You may have noticed that your Terminal says
      something about "bash"&mdash; bash is the [Bourne-again shell][bash] and
      was first created in 1989. A lot of cool kids these days use [zsh][zsh]
      (z shell), if you care about what the cool kids do.

  %h2 So what?
  :markdown
    So why do people still use it?

    Because it's _easy_.

    That is, it's hard to write programs that use graphics. Writing programs
    that run in a shell, though, is easy as escargot.

    Getting started in it is a bit strange, admittedly, but it opens up whole
    new worlds (it _is_ a whole new world, let's admit it), and you can dip
    your toes in as slowly as you want.

    %h2 So what is it?
    :markdown
      Open up Terminal (git-bash in windows) and also open up a file browser
      (Finder on a Mac, File Explorer on Windows). Find your "home" folder
      (the one that has your name on a Mac, "My Documents" or whatever on
      Windows). Now, in your shell, type "ls" and hit "Enter". It shows what's
      in the folder!

    %h2 It's a way to get around your computer
    :markdown
      Or at least, that's all you need to know for now. Let's walk through a
      few commands.

    In which we meet a heroic browser,
    a thoughtful server, and a large &amp;
    mysterious stack of documents

    %h2 A Word Of Caution
    %blockquote(cite="http://cl.ly/HG09")
      Relax and give the play a chance to strut its stuff&ndash;
      relax, stop wondering what it is all 'about'â€”
      %br
      %br
      like many strange and familiar things, Life included,
      this play isn't "about," it simply is.
      %br
      %br
      Don't try to enjoy it, let it try to enjoy you.
      Don't try to understand it, let it try to understand you.

      Don't get all distracted with needing to know every detail of
      everything we'll look at. No one knows all the details. You don't
      need to know binary. You don't even have to know how all of this
      is somehow binary underneath, just like an artist doesn't need to
      know the chemical compositions of her paints and canvas. Don't get
      distracted by asking too many questions, just soak. Learn like a
      baby. Immerse. Look around. Play.
